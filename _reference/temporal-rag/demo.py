demo.py — The Before/After Comparison

This is the viral moment of the article.

Run this and you see exactly what naive RAG gets wrong
and what the temporal layer fixes — on the same query,
with the same documents, side by side.

  Naive RAG ranks by semantic similarity alone.
  It has no concept of:
    - expired facts (rate limit policy v1 was superseded 6 months ago)
    - overturned findings (the 7B plateau finding no longer holds)
    - stale news (layoffs reversed, company fully recovered)
    - time-sensitive announcements (48hr rate limit suspension)

  The temporal layer adds three signals:
    1. Validity filtering  — hard-remove expired facts before ranking
    2. Time decay          — score = 0.5^(age / half_life)
    3. Recency normalization — relative freshness within the candidate pool

  The fix: two orthogonal axes.

  AXIS 1 — Validity state (3 states)
    EXPIRED  → hard removed before scoring
    VALID    → scored normally
    TEMPORAL → boosted (active time-bounded signals are high-value)

  AXIS 2 — Document kind (3 types)
    STATIC    → timeless fact (math, definitions). Decays slowly.
    VERSIONED → replaced by newer information (policies, tutorials).
                Time decay handles ranking; no validity window needed.
    EVENT     → true only within a time window (announcements, outages).
                The only kind that reaches TEMPORAL state.

  Without the kind axis, a versioned policy (policy_v2) looks identical
  to a time-bounded event — and gets mislabeled TEMPORAL.
  That's not a model — that's a heuristic.

  The semantic threshold closes the last gap:
    Fresh-but-irrelevant documents can dominate ranking when temporal
    scores are high. A minimum vector score guard prevents recency from
    overriding relevance entirely.

  Not all fresh information is useful.
  Production RAG must know when to ignore even active signals.

  Naive RAG retrieves what is similar.
  Temporal RAG retrieves what is still true.
  Production RAG must also know what is still relevant.
